Besides that, I started a new project in Arduino to adapt this code to a "LED Tic Tac Toe". To test it yourself click on this link https://www.tinkercad.com/things/230XiCf80JB.

### Why I developed this?
When I was bored at school, I used to play this game with a near friend. So, I remember those moments this year and I think "what if I do that on a program?"

### Requirements:
* To run this project on your computer,you need the JDK SE. This project is developed in JDK SE 14.0.1, which you can download on this link - [SEJDK14.0.1](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk14-downloads.html).
* You need to import this **Eclipse** project on your workspace.
